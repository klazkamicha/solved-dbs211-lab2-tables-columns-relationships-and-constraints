 <li>Visualize the sample database provided to you and display the relationships between the tables</li>

 <li>Be familiar with the sample database that we will be using for the remainder of the term</li>

</ul>

During this lab, you will need to create a relationship diagram.  There are many free tools available to you for this task.  One example would be http://draw.io.

LAB 02 â€“ SUBMISSION

You will be submitting either a PDF or a screenshot of a completed database relationship diagram.

<strong>Your Name, Student ID number and the date must be visible in the submitted file (not the file name).</strong>  This can be achieved by creating a simple box in the diagram before saving it.

By navigating through SQL Developer and looking at the Columns, Data and Constraints tabs for each table, you will create a relationship diagram for all the tables in the database.

Your diagram must include:

<ul>

 <li>All 8 tables</li>

 <li>The names of the entities (tables)</li>

 <li>The attributes (columns) for each table</li>

 <li>Lines representing the relationships between tables</li>

 <li>Crows Foot Symbols on the lines representing the type of relationship (1-1, 1-many)</li>

 <li>Required fields should be bolded</li>

 <li>Primary Key fields should be underlined <strong>or</strong> indicated with a PK beside it.</li>

 <li>Child fields in the relationships should be indicated with an FK beside it.</li>

</ul>
